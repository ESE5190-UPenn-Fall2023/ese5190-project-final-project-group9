# ESE5190 Final Project

Use this repository for your Final project.

# UltraSonic Radar detecor

This project utilizes two Arduino development boards, each with its respective main file renamed as arduino1_main.c and arduino2_main.c. The code relies on uart.c and uart.h as common dependency files. For the first Arduino, the additional dependencies are motor_sequence.c and motor_sequence.h, which should be compiled together. Meanwhile, the second Arduino requires compilation of the following dependencies as a group: ST7735.c, ST77735.h, ASCII_LUT.h, LCD_GFX.c, and LCD_GFX.h. Make sure to compile the appropriate files for each Arduino to ensure proper functionality.
